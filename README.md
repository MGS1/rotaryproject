# rotaryproject
COST: ~$90
+$50 for an Arduino kits for testing purposes (also can turn it into income by using it for the same project - soon to come!)
This is a wedding voicemail using a Teensy 4.0 with 4.0 Teensy Audio Shield. When the handset is lifted, a pre-recorded greeting message is played followed by a tone.  Recording starts, saves to an SD card, and continues until the handset is replaced. Optional feature to dial a number with rotary to play back the last message recorded. Allows all messages currently saved on SD card through earpiece. Files are saved on SD card as 44.1kHz, 16-bit, mono signed integer RAW audio format. 

NOTE: I ordered an Arduino for testing purposes and will upload this same project with a (possibly) more frugal price. More details to follow..

Below are the items to order from any vendor. This is the cheapest in my experience:

One Teensy 4.0 (there are deals on amazon so won’t link it) - MAKE SURE IT’S A 4.0!! I ordered an LC by accident the first time..

Any 30 amp or greater soldering iron (approx. $13 from Walmart) or any iron with a relatively sharp tip - this is crucial when soldering breakout boards.

Arduino Kit for Testing Purposes (recommend). I used these wires in my final project (easy and adherent to solder):
