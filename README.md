COST: ~$90
+$50 for an Arduino kits for testing purposes (also can turn it into the same project to eliminate 'project wate' - soon to come!)
This is a wedding voicemail using a Teensy 4.0 with 4.0 Teensy Audio Shield. When the handset is lifted, a pre-recorded greeting message is played followed by a beep.  Recording starts, saves to an SD card, and continues until the handset is replaced. A pushbutton allows for playback of the last recorded message as long as the button is held dow prior to picking up the headset. Files are saved on SD card as 44.1kHz, 16-bit, mono signed integer RAW audio format. "Greeting.wav" audio file stored on micro SD card must be converted to 16 bit signed 44.1 kHz must be used for the software torecoginize and then play 'greeting.wac' audio file.

NOTE: I ordered an Arduino for testing purposes and will upload this same project with a (possibly) more frugal price. More details to follow..

Below are the items to order from any vendor. This is the cheapest in my experience:

One Teensy 4.0 (there are deals on amazon so won’t link it) - MAKE SURE IT’S A 4.0!! I ordered an LC by accident the first time..

Any 30 amp or greater soldering iron (approx. $13 from Walmart) or any iron with a relatively sharp tip - this is crucial when soldering breakout boards.

Arduino Kit for Testing Purposes (recommend). I used these wires in my final project (easy and adherent to solder):
